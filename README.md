# REST API Test Automation with Java & REST Assured

A Java-based API test automation project using REST Assured, focused on functional API testing, negative scenarios, contract/schema validation, data-driven testing, performance testing, CI/CD and automated reporting.

The project demonstrates a layered approach to API test automation against publicly available REST APIs, with an emphasis on test coverage, maintainability, risk-based decisions and reliable reporting.

## 🔍 Start Here (for reviewers)

Short on time? These best show the range of technique in this project:

- [`VideoGameNegativeParameterizedTests`](src/test/java/config/VideoGameNegativeParameterizedTests.java) — boundary value analysis (`0`, `-1`, `99999`, `Integer.MAX_VALUE`) combined with parameterized JUnit runs
- [`FootballNegativeTests`](src/test/java/config/FootballNegativeTests.java) — negative auth testing (invalid token) against a live third-party API
- [`VideoGameTests`](src/test/java/config/VideoGameTests.java) — JSON Schema + XSD contract validation on the same endpoint
- [TEST_STRATEGY.md](TEST_STRATEGY.md) — the reasoning behind what's tested, how, and what's deliberately out of scope

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

- **API testing** — functional, negative, and boundary-value/parameterized testing (CRUD, status codes, response fields, response time)
- **Negative & auth testing** — invalid IDs, malformed bodies, and an invalid auth token, each asserted against its distinct expected failure mode
- **Contract validation** — JSON Schema and XSD validation against live responses
- **Query & data** — JsonPath/XmlPath/GPath querying, POJO (de)serialization with Jackson
- **Non-functional testing** — k6 load testing with an SLA-aligned latency threshold
- **Engineering practices** — CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Allure reporting with historical trend, runtime token injection, risk-based test scoping

## 🎮 APIs Under Test

**Video Game DB** — `https://videogamedb.uk/api/v2/` ([Swagger](https://videogamedb.uk/swagger-ui/index.html)). Public, read-only sandbox — writes are accepted but never persisted. Covered by `VideoGameTests`, `VideoGameNegativeTests`, `VideoGameParameterizedTests`, `VideoGameNegativeParameterizedTests`, `GpathJSONTest`, `GpathXMLTests` — CRUD, JSON Schema/XSD validation, POJO (de)serialization, GPath querying, negative and parameterized cases.

**Football Data** — `https://api.football-data.org/v4/` ([docs](https://www.football-data.org/)). Requires a free API token; without one, `FootbalTests` returns HTTP 403. Free tier is rate-limited to 10 requests/minute. `FootballNegativeTests` supplies its own invalid token and needs no setup — it runs in CI on every push.

```powershell
$env:FOOTBALL_DATA_API_TOKEN="your-token"
mvn -Dtest=FootbalTests test
```

---

## ▶️ Running Tests

```powershell
mvn test                                                              # all tests
mvn -Dtest=VideoGameTests test                                        # one class
mvn "-Dtest=VideoGameTests,GpathJSONTest,GpathXMLTests,MyFirstVideoGame" test   # no token required
```

**Allure report:**
```powershell
mvn -Dtest=VideoGameTests test
mvn allure:report     # HTML → target/site/allure-maven-plugin/
mvn allure:serve      # open in browser
```

**k6 load test** (VideoGame DB only — Football API is token-gated and rate-limited, so it's excluded):
```powershell
k6 run performance/videogame-load-test.js
```

| Test class | Tests | Stable | Known failure causes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `VideoGameTests` | 14 | ✅ | None |
| `VideoGameNegativeTests` | 4 | ✅ | None |
| `VideoGameParameterizedTests` | 5 | ✅ | None |
| `VideoGameNegativeParameterizedTests` | 4 | ✅ | None |
| `FootbalTests` | 12 | ⚠️ | HTTP 403 (no token), 429 (rate limit), 500 (transient) |
| `FootballNegativeTests` | 1 | ✅ | None (needs no token) |
| `GpathJSONTest` | 5 | ✅ | None |
| `GpathXMLTests` | 5 | ✅ | None |
| `MyFirstVideoGame` | 2 | ✅ | None |
| **Total** | **52** | | |

## 🚀 CI/CD & Reporting

Every push to `main` runs the non-Football suite via GitHub Actions and publishes an Allure report — with historical trend, Environment, and Categories widgets — to GitHub Pages (`gh-pages` branch). CI also runs (tests only, no deploy) on `feature/**` and `fix/**` branches.

The k6 load test runs on manual trigger only (`Actions → k6 Load Test → Run workflow`), to avoid hammering the shared sandbox API.

## 📚 Project Background

The first version of this project started from the [Rest Assured Fundamentals](https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-assured-fundamentals/?referralCode=2A76479D71A62609414D) course on Udemy. Since then it's been independently developed and extended well past the original tutorial scope — Allure reporting with historical trend, GitHub Actions CI, k6 load testing, negative and parameterized tests, contract/schema validation, dynamic Football API token handling, and a full test strategy, among other things (see [Completed Improvements](#-completed-improvements) above and [TEST_STRATEGY.md](TEST_STRATEGY.md)).
